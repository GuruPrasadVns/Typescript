## What is TypeScript?

### Typescript is an open source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a typed superset of Javascript that compiles down to plain Javascript which understood by the browsers.

### In simple terms, typescript combines the javascript we know, ES6,ES7 and a few additional features.

## Why TypeScript

### As we know Javascript is dynamically typed language as we cannot determine the type of variable until the runtime. Typescript add type support to the Javascript so errors are identified at the compile time of your code. This leads to less error prone code and best part is that specifying the type is completely optional. When you don't specify the type Typescript will enforce the type for you and still points out the error.

### Enhance IDE support

### Rapid Growth and usage in wide variety of applications. For example, Typescript is the main programming language of angular and find its way in react and vue as well.
